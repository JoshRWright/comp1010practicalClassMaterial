# Department of Computing, Macquarie University

## Workshop - Recursion

# NOTE

We will continue working with the `COMP1010_source_codes_for_students` project. This week, we are dealing with package `practicalClassCodes.week06`.

## Outline

- 6 to 15 minutes: a note for practical exams about `NullPointerException`
- 16 to 35 minutes: demos
	- numeric-based examples
	- String-based examples
- 36 to end of class: 
	- practice,
	- practice, and, 
	- more practice

## IMPORTANT

Students should pair-up for the rest of this workshop. For all programs, you should design the solution (not the code!) together, then person A should code and person B should act as an observer. If the observer sees a mistake, (s)he may interject.

## Demo of recursive design and coding

In the first task, your tutor will design and implement a recursive solution for,

1. [Number-based problem](https://codingbat.com/prob/p163932) 
2. [String-based problem](https://codingbat.com/prob/p170371)

## PRACTICE - IN PAIRS

Practice questions sequentially from [https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1)

The order is:

1. `factorial` (hint available, use only if needed)
2. `bunnyEars` (hint available, use only if needed)
3. `fibonacci`
4. `bunnyEars2`
5. `triangle`
6. `sumDigits`
7. `count7`
8. and so on...

## Week 6 submission

You should be working with package `practicePackage.recursion`, stages 1 and 2 only. 
There are a total of 21 functions across Stages 1 and 2. 
Your code should pass **AT LEAST 10 functions to pass the hurdle**. 
Each function is worth 5 marks. Solving 20 functions will get you a full mark for week 6. 
Solving the 21st function will earn you my respect but unfortunately no bonus marks.

Drag and Drop **all** relevant java files from the package explorer into "Week 6 submission" submission box by **Sunday 4th April, 21:00**.
Any compilation error, StackOverflowError or any infinite loop in ANY of the files will result in an automatic zero.

## ADVANCED PRACTICE QUESTIONS

If you are done with Recursion - 1, move on to [https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2).

## ADVANCED QUESTION

**This is for students looking for something fairly challenging.**
Solve as many questions as you can from [RecursionService.java] in `practiceClassCodes.week06.RecursionService`
